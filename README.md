# Traffic_Sign-Img_Classification

# *Data Collections*
There are around 58 classes and each class has around 120 images. The labels.csv file has the respective description of the traffic sign class. You can change the assignment of these classIDs with descriptions. We can use the basic CNN model to get decent validation accuracy. We have around 2000 files for testing.

# *Deployment using Streamlit Steps*
1. Open VS code 
2. Install all the necessary libraries
3. Copy the code provided Of streamlit
4. Change the address of ".h5 file"
5. Run the code
6. Copy the streamlit code shown in output(similar to this :streamlit run C:\Users\Niharika\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\ipykernel_launcher.py)

7. Paste the code in the terminal 
8. Now the streamlit code will be open in your browser(Local host)
9. Now upload image and check accuracy
